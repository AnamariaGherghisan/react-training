## User Story

As a React app I should be able to render a list of users with all their information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Component should render the list of users when users are present, ensure that the component accepts a prop called _users_ where an array of user objects are passed.
- Component should contain a title "Your Users"
- Component should render a message "No users present." when users are not present
- Each user card should contain the following:
  - the full name (required)
  - the company name (required)
  - the full address (required)
  - the street value is optional and only rendered in the address when available
  - if user is a premium user then render a premium user icon [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons/crown?f=classic&s=solid)
