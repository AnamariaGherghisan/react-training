## User Story

As a user I want to see some basic content being rendered via React.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `HelloWorld` component should render some information about yourself such as:
  - Your full name
  - Your profile image
  - A short description about yourself
- Must provide some basic styling and layout
- Must be mobile responsive

## Getting Started

- Add code in the index.js file within the challenge folder
- Add tests in the index.test.js file within the challenge folder
- Do not change the name of the component as the playground is looking for a component with the mentioned name
