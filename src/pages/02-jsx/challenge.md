## User Story

As a React component I should be able to render some data using JSX.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Component should contain some text which is constructed using a function **generateGreetingMessage** which accepts 2 parameters _firstName_ and _lastName_.

- Component should contain some text which displays the result of _100 + 300_.

- Component should contain conditionally render text. If a randomly generated number is below 0.5 "Hello" is rendered and if a randomly generated number is greater than or equal to 0.5 then "Goodbye" is rendered. Use **Math.random()** to generate a random number between 0 and 1.
